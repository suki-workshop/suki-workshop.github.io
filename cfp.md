# Call for Papers
World knowledge is distributed across diverse resources in either structured (tables, lists, graphs, and databases) or unstructured forms (texts, large pretrained language models). Recently, there have been extensive efforts to represent, inject, and ground knowledge in various NLP tasks. Because many downstream applications require the integration of structured and unstructured knowledge, it is essential to design more generalized models to handle multiple sources of knowledge inputs. However, recent NLP progress is mostly focused on dealing with homogeneous external knowledge resource in a single form. This workshop aims to bring researchers from different backgrounds together to discuss challenges and promote solutions in NLP techniques for jointly dealing with structured and unstructured knowledge. This draws wide attention from multiple NLP areas such as Information Extraction, Question Answering, Semantic Parsing, Information Retrieval, Fact Verification, Summarization, Data-to-Text Generation, and Conversational AI.

We seek submissions in two tracks:

<b> Research Track.</b> We welcome submissions on research that broadly relates to combining Structured and Unstructured Knowledge on topics including but not limited to: 
- Datasets combining Structured and Unstructured Data
- Data Augmentation for Structured and Unstructured Data
- Joint PreTraining for Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Joint Modeling with Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Conversational AI over Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Summarization over Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Language Generation over Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Multilingual Data and Modeling for Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Fairness and Bias in Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Transfer Learning over Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Multitask Learning over Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Human-in-the-loop Learning for Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Human-in-the-loop Evaluation for Models over Structured and Unstructured Knowledge
- Interpretability for Models over Structured and Unstructured Knowledge

<b> Shared Task Track.</b> We plan to host two shared tasks: UnifiedSKG and FinQA. Please check the [shared task](https://suki-workshop.github.io/shared_task) page for more information. We accept system descriptions of our shared tasks as workshop submissions.

## Submission Guidelines
Submissions should have at least 4 pages and at most 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references and appendices.
Accepted papers will be given 1 additional content page to address reviewers' comments.
Please use the official [ARR style files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) available as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5f64f1fb97c4c50001b60549) to format your papers.
Our reviewing policy is double-blind, and the submissions should be fully anonymized.
Please submit through our [Openreview submission site](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2022/Workshop/SUKI).

### Dual Sumbission
We also allow submissions that are under review in other venues or have preprint versions.
But please make sure to follow dual submission policies from other venues.
<!-- Especially, you can submit your NAACL 2022 submissions to this workshop as well. -->

### Archival vs Non-Archival
During submission, please also indicate if you want your paper to be archival or non-archival.
Archival papers, if accepted, will be included in the workshop proceeding, while non-archival will not be included.
Both archival or non-archival papers, if accepted, will be presented at workshop.

### Anonymity Period
We do not enforce an anonymity period. We allow preprint servers such as arXiv at any point of time.
